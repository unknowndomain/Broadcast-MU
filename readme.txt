Broadcast MU is a plugin for WordPress MU which allows you to broadcast a post to one or more other blogs on the same installation of WordPress MU.

== Description ==

Broadcast MU is a plugin for WordPress MU which allows you to broadcast a post to one or more other blogs on the same installation of WordPress MU by simply checking the box next to those you wish to send it to.

You can enable this plugin on individual blogs or site wide.

This plugin is for WordPress MU only because regular WordPress only supports having one blog anyway.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `broadcast-mu.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress MU.
3. Create a new post from the `New Post` menu in WordPress MU and tick the blogs you want from the `Broadcast` box.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can I only see some of the blogs on the site? =
This is because Broadcast MU only allows you to post to blogs which you have access to publish on.

= Can I enable the plugin for all users on my site? =
Yes, Either upload it to the `/wp-content/mu-plugins/` directory or in the `Plugins` menu in WordPress MU click 'Activate site wide'.

= Can I choose on which blogs my post will display? =
Yes, simply click the blogs you want when posting in WordPress.

= Can I modify or delete a post from all blogs simultaneously? =
No, once broadcasted they cannot be modified or deleted simultaneously however you can still go and change them manually.

== Screenshots ==

== Changelog ==
